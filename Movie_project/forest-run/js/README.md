For the project, I decided to inspire myself from one of my favorites, the Star wars franchise. Having made different games in other projects, I wanted to explore a new type of game, especially the isometric perspective. To make it simpler, I set up myself to do a dodging game where the player has to survive a timer by dodging the obstacle coming to him. Playing Battlefront 2, I got inspired by the land speeder used in the forest of Endor appearing in Return of the Jedi. The player would be an imperial scout having to traverse the forest on top of his speeder bike to alert an imperial base of an incoming rebel attack. My main focus was to create the illusion of speed even if the player stayed in place. To do so, I have set up ground details, grass and rock particles, to loop around the screen and create the speed of the player. Since it is an isometric view, I coded the movement of the player and the terrain to adapt itself to the screen to keep the isometric perspective on any screen size. As an extra function, I added the Annyang! plug in for the player to impact the game through voice recognition. Those functions increase and decrease the speed of the terrain details, impacting also the timer, creating a risk and reward situation where the obstacle comes faster as the player reaches victory faster. Finally, for the difficulty, I made it increase itself as the timer drained down, adding more obstacles the longer the player progresses.
